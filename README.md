#  📚 Memory Game

Hi,
I'm Yoann, I'm currently deepening my knowledge in web development. I'm specialized in React frontend development.
I had fun coding all these projects!
Feel free to ask me questions and don't hesitate to look at my other projects ;)
Have fun coding!

## ✍️ Description 

The goal of this challenge is to create the mechanics of a memory game using React's lifecycle, state, and inverse data flow mechanics.

The assets and the entire style of the application will be provided in the base setup so that you can focus on the React mechanics.

As soon as the user arrives on the application, the 16 cards must be shuffled using the Math.random() method.

👉 Only two cards can be selected at a time (one after the other): if they match, they remain visible, otherwise, they are flipped back over.

👉 Once the game is over, all the cards are flipped back over and shuffled.

You are free to modify the base code as long as the game has exactly 16 cards, each represented by a Card component.

This challenge is suitable for developers who want to improve their skills with React and create a simple yet engaging game. Feel free to fork this project and start coding!
